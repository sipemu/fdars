# Generate Gaussian Process Samples

Generates functional data samples from a Gaussian process with the
specified mean and covariance functions.

## Usage

``` r
make_gaussian_process(n, t, cov = kernel_gaussian(), mean = 0, seed = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- n:

  Number of samples to generate.

- t:

  Evaluation points (vector for 1D, list of two vectors for 2D).

- cov:

  Covariance function (from `kernel_gaussian`, `kernel_matern`, etc.).

- mean:

  Mean function. Can be a scalar (default 0), a vector of length equal
  to the number of evaluation points, or a function.

- seed:

  Optional random seed for reproducibility.

## Value

An fdata object containing the generated samples.

## Details

This function generates samples from a Gaussian process with the
specified covariance structure. The samples are generated by computing
the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix and multiplying by
standard normal random variables.

For 2D functional data, pass `t` as a list of two vectors representing
the grid in each dimension.

## Examples

``` r
# Generate smooth GP samples with Gaussian covariance
t <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 100)
fd <- make_gaussian_process(n = 20, t = t,
                            cov = kernel_gaussian(length_scale = 0.2),
                            seed = 42)
plot(fd)


# Generate rough GP samples with exponential covariance
fd_rough <- make_gaussian_process(n = 20, t = t,
                                  cov = kernel_exponential(length_scale = 0.1),
                                  seed = 42)
plot(fd_rough)


# Generate 2D GP samples (surfaces)
s <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 20)
t2 <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 20)
fd2d <- make_gaussian_process(n = 5, t = list(s, t2),
                              cov = kernel_gaussian(length_scale = 0.3),
                              seed = 42)
plot(fd2d)


# Generate GP with non-zero mean
mean_func <- function(t) sin(2 * pi * t)
fd_mean <- make_gaussian_process(n = 10, t = t,
                                 cov = kernel_gaussian(variance = 0.1),
                                 mean = mean_func, seed = 42)
plot(fd_mean)
```
